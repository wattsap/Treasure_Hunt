A few different backtracking algorithms; breadth-first, depth-first, uniform cost. 
PBL1b: Treasure Hunt Puzzle Generation
Imagine if you will that the Watauga Democrat has an idea for how to attract new subscribers to the
print edition of the newspaper.  A computer science student from ASU was interning with them and told
them about the Treasure Hunt game the class implemented in 2440.  “What an interesting game!” they
said.  “Can you write a computer program to solve it, so we can post the solutions in the next edition?”
they asked.  “Well, of course!  Any 2440 student can implement a recursive backtracking algorithm to
solve the game.”  “Great!” they said.  “We want to publish an easy puzzle on Wednesday, and medium
puzzle on Friday, and a hard puzzle on Sunday.  Can you do that?”
Your team has been selected by the Watauga Democrat to investigate and evaluate current methods for
solving puzzles like Treasure Hunt, including the solution quality and computational efficiency of each
approach.  You will randomly generate solvable Treasure Hunt puzzles and recommend a method for
rating the difficulty of each puzzle.  Having generated hundreds or thousands of puzzles, you will
visualize and quantify the variability in their difficulty level.  
The Watauga Democrat wants to use Treasure Hunt puzzles that have the following properties
 The board is 21 x 21
 The initial position is the center of the board
 The goal position is any of the four corners of the board
 The numbers on the board are between 1 – 9
 The best path is the one that travels the shortest distance.
